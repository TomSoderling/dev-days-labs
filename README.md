![Dev Days Labs](header.png)

Xamarin Dev Days provide attendees with an intense, hands-on learning experience. Spend the morning exploring mobile development with sessions from Xamarin, our technology partners, and members of your local developer community, then roll up your sleeves for an afternoon dedicated to diving into code.

Each Xamarin Dev Days is unique, but youâ€™ll always walk away with a better understanding of how you can build, test, and monitor native iOS, Android, and Windows apps with Xamarin.

Inside this repo you will find all of the presentations, demos, and hands on labs that you will experience at Xamarin Dev Days!




## Tom's Edit: ##

Added a few slides to the deck for the Hands On Lab, to be clear about:
 - Directions on environment setup (a lot of people seemed to miss this in the dev days invitation)
 - Where/how to get the lab code
 - Where the lab directions are and how to use them
 - A quick visual & description of what we'd be building in the lab
 - A quick visual & description of what MVVM is
 - A fix for a non-intuitive issue with lab code on Windows w/ Visual Studio
